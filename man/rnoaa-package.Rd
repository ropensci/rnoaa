\description{
rnoaa is an R interface to NOAA climate data.
}
\section{Data Sources}{

Many functions in this package interact with the National Climatic Data
Center application programming interface (API) at
https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2, all of
which functions start with \code{ncdc_}. An access token, or API key, is
required to use all the \code{ncdc_} functions. The key is required by NOAA,
not us. Go to the link given above to get an API key.

More NOAA data sources are being added through time. Data sources and their
function prefixes are:
\itemize{
\item \code{buoy_*} - NOAA Buoy data from the National Buoy Data Center
\item \code{gefs_*} - GEFS forecast ensemble data
\item \code{ghcnd_*}/\code{meteo_*} - GHCND daily data from NOAA
\item \code{isd_*} - ISD/ISH data from NOAA
\item \code{homr_*} - Historical Observing Metadata Repository (HOMR)
vignette
\item \code{ncdc_*} - NOAA National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) vignette
(examples)
\item \code{sea_ice} - Sea ice vignette
\item \code{storm_} - Storms (IBTrACS) vignette
\item \code{swdi} - Severe Weather Data Inventory (SWDI) vignette
\item \code{tornadoes} - From the NOAA Storm Prediction Center
\item \code{argo_*} - Argo buoys
\item \code{coops_search} - NOAA CO-OPS - tides and currents data
\item \code{cpc_prcp} - rainfall data from the NOAA Climate
Prediction Center (CPC)
\item \code{arc2} - rainfall data from Africa Rainfall Climatology
version 2
\item \code{bsw} - Blended sea winds (BSW)
\item \code{ersst} - NOAA Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface
Temperature (ERSST) data
\item \code{lcd} - Local Climitalogical Data from NOAA
}
}

\section{Where data comes from and government shutdowns}{


Government shutdowns can greatly affect data sources in this package.
The following is a breakdown of the functions that fetch data by
HTTP vs. FTP - done this way as we've noticed that during the ealry 2019
border wall shutdown most FTP services were up, while those that were down
were HTTP; though not all HTTP services were down.
\itemize{
\item HTTP info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol
\item FTP info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol
}

HTTP services (whether service is/was up or down during early 2019 shutdown)
\itemize{
\item \code{buoy_*} - Up
\item \code{gefs_*} - Up
\item \code{homr_*} - Up
\item \code{ncdc_*} - Down
\item \code{swdi} - Down
\item \code{tornadoes} - Down
\item \code{argo_*} - Up (all HTTP except two fxns, see also FTP below)
\item \code{coops_search} - Up
\item \code{ersst} - Down
\item \code{lcd} - Down
\item \code{se_*} - Down
}

FTP services (whether service is/was up or down during early 2019 shutdown)
\itemize{
\item \code{ghcnd_*} - Up
\item \code{isd_*} - Up
\item \code{sea_ice} - Up
\item \code{storm_} - Up
\item \code{argo_*} - Up (only two fxns: \code{\link[=argo]{argo()}}, \code{\link[=argo_buoy_files]{argo_buoy_files()}})
\item \code{cpc_prcp} - Up
\item \code{arc2} - Up
\item \code{bsw} - Up
}

We've tried to whenever possible detect whether a service is error
due to a government shutdown and give a message saying so. If you know
a service is down that rnoaa interacts with but we don't fail well
during a shutdown let us know.

\section{A note about NCDF data}{


Some functions use netcdf files, including:
\itemize{
\item \code{gefs}
\item \code{ersst}
\item \code{buoy}
\item \code{bsw}
\item \code{argo}
}

You'll need the \code{ncdf4} package for those functions, and those only.
\code{ncdf4} is in Suggests in this package, meaning you only need
\code{ncdf4} if you are using any of the functions listed above. You'll get
an informative error telling you to install \code{ncdf4} if you don't have
it and you try to use the those functions. Installation of \code{ncdf4}
should be straightforward on any system.
}

\section{The \code{meteo} family of functions}{


The \code{meteo} family of functions are prefixed with \code{meteo_} and
provide a set of helper functions to:
\itemize{
\item Identify candidate stations from a latitude/longitude pair
\item Retrieve complete data for one or more stations (\code{meteo_coverage()})
}
}
