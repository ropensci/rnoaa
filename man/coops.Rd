\arguments{
\item{begin_date}{(numeric) Date in yyyymmdd format. Required}

\item{end_date}{(numeric) Date in yyyymmdd format. Required}

\item{station_name}{(numeric) a station name. Required}

\item{product}{(character) Specify the data type. See below for Details.
Required}

\item{datum}{(character) See below for Details. Required for all water
level products.}

\item{units}{(character) Specify metric or english (imperial) units,
one of 'metric', 'english'.}

\item{time_zone}{(character) Time zone, one of 'gmt', 'lst', 'lst_ldt'.
For GMT, we convert time stamps to GMT. For LST, we look up the time zone
of the station with its lat/lon values, and assign that time zone. When
\code{product="predictions"} we don't adjust times at all.}

\item{application}{(character) If called within an external package, set
to the name of your organization. Optional}

\item{...}{Curl options passed on to \link[crul:verb-GET]{crul::verb-GET}

\value{
List, of length one or two.
\itemize{
\item metadata A list of metadata with slots id, name, lat, lon
\item data A data.frame with data

Options for the product paramter. One of:
\itemize{
\item water_level - Preliminary or verified water levels, depending on
availability
\item air_temperature - Air temperature as measured at the station
\item water_temperature - Water temperature as measured at the station
\item wind - Wind speed, direction, and gusts as measured at the station
\item air_pressure - Barometric pressure as measured at the station
\item air_gap - Air Gap (distance between a bridge and the water's surface)
at the station
\item conductivity - The water's conductivity as measured at the station
\item visibility - Visibility from the station's visibility sensor. A
measure of atmospheric clarity
\item humidity - Relative humidity as measured at the station
\item salinity - Salinity and specific gravity data for the station
\item one_minute_water_level - One minute water level data for the station
\item predictions - 6 minute predictions water level data for the station
\item hourly_height - Verified hourly height water level data for
the station
\item high_low - Verified high/low water level data for the station
\item daily_mean - Verified daily mean water level data for the station
\item monthly_mean - Verified monthly mean water level data for the station
\item datums - datums data for the stations
\item currents - Currents data for currents stations
