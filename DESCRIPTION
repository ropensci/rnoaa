Title: NOAA climate data from R.
Description: This is an R wrapper to many NOAA APIs including the NCDC climate
    API at http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2. There are functions
    for each of the API endpoints: data, data categories, data sets, data types,
    locations, location categories, and stations. In addition, we have an
    interface for NOAA sea ice data that is not part of the climate data API,
    the NOAA severe weather inventory, and ERDDAP data. NOAA buoy data is only
    on the buoy branch in the Github repository for this package (see url below).
